# Master-s-Project

**Problem Statement**

The basic role of a designer is to construct an instinctive and engaging website. There are
numerous steps associated with creating a website prior to pushing it to live starting from
drawing concept sketches to testing process. HTML and CSS are the most widely recognised
that are being used in web development. Executing the interfaces in HTML and CSS is
cumbersome and painful task. At the same time, the front-end developers are also not very
proficient. Simultaneously, there are multiple iterations of the design are necessary to make a
website appealing to the customers. To manage the situation, there is a need of a powerful tool
that ought to speed-up the front-end development, coding, testing the layout quicker and more
efficient.

**Aim and objective**

The aim of this project is to build a deep learning pipeline that will convert the visual designs
into intermediatory code that enables rendering components ready to be scaled at the
industrialization level.

**Architectures Used**

Inception-ResNet architecture is nothing but the use of residual connections in the inception architecture. Inception ResNetV2 is a type of convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet Dataset. The network is 164 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 classes. This network has an input size of 299x299 and the output is a list of estimated class probabilities.
